# Setup
Begin by running the following command in the root folder to install dependencies  
```
npm install
```

```
psql
CREATE DATABASE <db_name>
```

```  
To start the server, run the following command

```

# How to set up knexfile  
```knexfile.js``` can be find at the following path from the root folder: ```./backend/db```  

You will need to set up a ```.local.env``` file in the root folder which contains the following variables:  
```
API_KEY=<YOUR SECRET API KEY>
API_URL=https://v3.football.api-sports.io
API_HOST=v3.football.api-sports.io
DB_USER=<your_db_username>
DB_NAME=<your_db_name>
DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
NODE_ENV=development
SECRET_TOKEN=<YOUR SECRET TOKEN FOR JWT>
```  
You will also want to add your ```.local.env``` to the ```.gitignore``` file in the root folder to avoid your sensitive data from being pushed to github
