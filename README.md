# Getting Started
### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Things you will need:
* Install [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* Get an api key from [API FOOTBALL](https://dashboard.api-football.com/register) and [The Sports Database](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php)  

# Setup
Begin by running the following command in the root folder to install dependencies  
```
npm install
```  
Next, create a postgresql database  
```
psql
CREATE DATABASE <db_name>
```  
After your database is created and running, run the following commands to create database and add seed data  
```
npm run migrate:latest
npm run seed:data
```  
To start the server, run the following command  
```
npm start
```  
Next run the following commands to change directory to ```./frontend``` and install npm dependencies for react  
```
cd frontend
npm install
```  
Finally, to start the react app run the following command in ```./frontend```  
```
npm start
```  
# How to set up knexfile  
```knexfile.js``` can be find at the following path from the root folder: ```./backend/db```  

You will need to set up a ```.local.env``` file in the root folder which contains the following variables:  
```
API_KEY=<YOUR SECRET API KEY>
API_URL=https://v3.football.api-sports.io
API_HOST=v3.football.api-sports.io
DB_USER=<your_db_username>
DB_NAME=<your_db_name>
DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
NODE_ENV=development
SECRET_TOKEN=<YOUR SECRET TOKEN FOR JWT>
```  
You will also want to add your ```.local.env``` to the ```.gitignore``` file in the root folder to avoid your sensitive data from being pushed to github
